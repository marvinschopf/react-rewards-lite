# rewards-lite
This is a fork of the **awesome** [`react-rewards`](https://github.com/thedevelobear/react-rewards) by [Develobear](https://github.com/thedevelobear) which simply removed the Memphis animation to save enormously on package size. 

## Installation
Using `yarn`:
```bash
yarn add rewards-lite
```

Using `npm`:
```bash
npm install rewards-lite
```

## Usage
The usage and API is the same as from [`react-rewards`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-rewards), except for the removed Memphis animation.
